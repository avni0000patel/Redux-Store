## Technologies Used
Apollo client - allows you to easily build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL

Jest-dom testing library - a companion library for Testing Library that provides custom DOM element matchers for Jest

React testing library - builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components

User-event testing library - simulates the real events that would happen in the browser as the user interacts with it

Apollo-server-express - production-ready Node.js GraphQL server for Express

Bcrypt - hashes and salts passwords securely

Bootstrap - the CSS framework

Concurrently - runs commands concurrently

Express - the most popular Node web framework that makes it easy to work with routes

Graphql - a Query Language and Runtime which can target any service

Jsonwebtoken - JSON Web Token implementation (symmetric and asymmetric)

Jwt-decode - decodes JWT tokens, mostly useful for browser applications

Mongoose - a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment

Nodemon - a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected

React - a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces

React-bootstrap - a Bootstrap 5 components built with React

React-dom - serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React

React-router-dom - declarative routing for React web applications

`npm run build`

`npm run develop`

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
